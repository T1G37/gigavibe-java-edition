>> If you wish to install the requirements, unzip the files from the download links and place all of the executable files in the modules folder, if this folder doesnt exist, make it where the .jar file is BUT MAKE SURE THAT ffprobe is called "ffprobe", yt-dlp is called "yt-dlp" and ffmpeg is called "ffmpeg".
